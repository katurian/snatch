To install Newspaper, enter this into your command line interpreter:
```
pip install Newspaper3k
```

### GetArticle_input.py

Article is at www.wired.com$theres-no-good-reason-to-trust-blockchain-technolog.txt

### GetArticles.py
Takes an **RSS** feed link as an argument then uses **FeedParser** (https://pythonhosted.org/feedparser/introduction.html) to retrieve article links, creating a list of URLs. It iterates through this list and outputs a text file for each URL item. You do not need to install **FeedParser**, as it comes with your Python installation by default.

Example:
